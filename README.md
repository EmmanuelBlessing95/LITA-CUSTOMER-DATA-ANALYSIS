# LITA-CUSTOMER-DATA-ANALYSIS
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends. My goal is to understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. The final deliverable is a Power BI dashboard that presents my analysis. *(The picture below is gotten from freepiks website)*

**Objective**: To support decision-making by uncovering actionable insights that can improve customer retention and optimize revenue.

### Data Sources

This data was given to me to work on in my Ladies in Tech Academy class with Incubator Hub. The data had 8 columns and 75001 rows. 


## Project Overview

This analysis project is divided into three main components:

1. **Excel Analysis**: Preliminary data analysis using pivot tables to identify subscription patterns, average subscription duration, and the most popular subscription types.
2. **SQL Queries**: Database queries to extract insights, such as customer counts by region, popular subscription types, and trends in cancellations and revenue.
3. **Power BI Dashboard**: An interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key insights on customer segments, subscription types, cancellations, and revenue trends.

### Tools used
- Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and analysis.
- SQL(Structured Query Language) for querying data.
- Power Bi for Data Visualisation.
- GitHub for portfolio building.

## Data Analysis Approach

### 1. Excel Analysis

- **Pivot Tables**: Used to calculate metrics like the average subscription duration and most popular subscription types.
  
### Key Questions 

1. Analyze customer data using pivot tables to find subscription patterns.

2. Calculate the average subscription duration and identify the most popular
